(to list all of a user's friends)</p>\n\n<p>I'm thinking that in the controller, something like this would be appropriate:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class User {\n    function index() {\n        echo 'user index';\n    }\n}\n\nclass Friend extends User {\n    function index($user_id) {\n        echo 'friend index';\n    }    \n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then you would have the following map:</p>\n\n<pre><code>/users              -&gt; User::index()\n/users/{id}         -&gt; User::view($id)\n/users/{id}/friends -&gt; Friend::index($user_id)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I wanted to put the Friend class inside the User class but apparently you can't do that in PHP so this is the best I could come up with. Thoughts?</p>\n\n<p>What URL would use for editing your list of friends? <code>/users/{id}/friends/edit</code> could work, but it doesn't seem appropriate, since you should never be editing someone else's friend list. Would <code>/account/friends/edit</code> be a better choice? Where would you put the corresponding code for that? In a friend controller, or a user controller, or a specialized account controller?</p>\n\n<p>Bonus question: which do you prefer? <code>/photos/delete/{id}</code> or <code>/photos/{id}/delete</code></p>\n\n<p><hr /></p>\n\n<p><strong>The answers:</strong></p>\n\n<p>So, what I've gathered from the answers is that if the \"thing\" is complicated (like \"friends\") but doesn't have its own controller, you can give it one without a model, or if it's not, you should stuff it in with whatever it's most closely related to. Your URLs should not influence where you put your code. Most people seem to think you should stick to <code>/controller/action/{id}</code> whever possible, because it's what people are familiar with.</p>\n\n<p>No one really commented on the extended class aside from saying it's \"awkward\". Perhaps FriendList would have been a more appropriate class in that case if I really wanted to separate it out.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for all the answers :)</p>\n", "Tags": "php url-routing conventions", "Id": "16", "Title": "PHP framework URL conventions"}

I'm having a brain crash trying to figure out what the correct pattern is for specifying style bundles such that standalone css and image sets such as jQuery UI work.</p>\n\n<p>I have a typical MVC site structure with <code>/Content/css/</code> which contains my base CSS such as <code>styles.css</code>. Within that css folder I also have subfolders such as <code>/jquery-ui</code> which contains its CSS file plus an <code>/images</code> folder. Image paths in the jQuery UI CSS are relative to that folder and I don't want to mess with them.</p>\n\n<p>As I understand it, when I specify a <code>StyleBundle</code> I need to specify a virtual path which does not also match a real content path, because (assuming I'm ignoring routes to Content) IIS would then try to resolve that path as a physical file. So I'm specifying:</p>\n\n<pre><code>bundles.Add( \n    new StyleBundle(\"~/Content/styles/jquery-ui\")\n        .Include(\"~/Content/css/jquery-ui/*.css\"));\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>rendered using:</p>\n\n<p><code>@Styles.Render(\"~/Content/styles/jquery-ui\")</code></p>\n\n<p>I can see the request going out to:</p>\n\n<p><code>http://localhost/MySite/Content/styles/jquery-ui?v=nL_6HPFtzoqrts9nwrtjq0VQFYnhMjY5EopXsK8cxmg1</code></p>\n\n<p>This is returning the correct minified CSS response. \nBut then the browser sends a request for a relatively linked image as:</p>\n\n<p><code>http://localhost/MySite/Content/styles/images/ui-bg_highlight-soft_100_eeeeee_1x100.png</code></p>\n\n<p>Which is a <code>404</code>.</p>\n\n<p>I understand that the last part of my URL <code>jquery-ui</code> is an extensionless URL, a handler for my bundle, so I can see why the relative request for the image is simply <code>/styles/images/</code>. </p>\n\n<p>So my question is <strong>what is the correct way</strong> of handling this situation? </p>\n", "Tags": "css jquery-ui asp.net-mvc-4 bundle asp.net-optimization", "Id": "31", "Title": "MVC4 StyleBundle not resolving images"}

This process has been running for maybe 7 or 8 years on an ASP.NET (.NET 2.0) webform and suddenly (sometime over the last 6-18 months) it's not working the way it used to. Perhaps after .NET 4.0 was installed on the client server, or maybe after some other framework update(?) or windows update(?) or provider update(?). Our DLL has not changed in a few years. I'd like to fix this legacy process with the least amount of hacking and slashing possible.</p>\n\n<p>There are three data types being exported: integer, string, and decimal. <b>The problem is that all the integer columns are being exported as decimals now.</b> The CSV export library looks at the datatypes of the columns to determine the correct output format, so I use a XSD file to define my DataSet before filling it. Here is a simplified example of the XSD file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" standalone=\"yes\"?&gt;\n&lt;xs:schema id=\"FDSR\" xmlns=\"\" xmlns:xs=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema\" xmlns:msdata=\"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xml-msdata\"&gt;\n  &lt;xs:element name=\"FDSR\" msdata:IsDataSet=\"true\" msdata:Locale=\"en-CA\"&gt;\n    &lt;xs:complexType&gt;\n      &lt;xs:choice maxOccurs=\"unbounded\"&gt;\n        &lt;xs:element name=\"TBLEXPORT\"&gt;\n          &lt;xs:complexType&gt;\n            &lt;xs:sequence&gt;\n              &lt;xs:element name=\"INTCOLUMN1\" type=\"xs:integer\" minOccurs=\"0\" /&gt;\n              &lt;xs:element name=\"STRCOLUMN2\" type=\"xs:string\" minOccurs=\"0\" /&gt;\n              &lt;xs:element name=\"DBLCOLUMN3\" type=\"xs:decimal\" minOccurs=\"0\" /&gt;\n            &lt;/xs:sequence&gt;\n          &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;\n        &lt;/xs:element&gt;\n      &lt;/xs:choice&gt;\n    &lt;/xs:complexType&gt;\n  &lt;/xs:element&gt;\n&lt;/xs:schema&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The data types defined for each column used to persist after the data was loaded, but now they are reset by the data load. For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Dim ds as New DataSet\nds.ReadXmlSchema(\"MyFile.xsd\")\n\n' Breakpoint here: \n' ds.Tables(0).Columns(0).DataType shows: {Name = \"Int64\" FullName = \"System.Int64\"}\n\nDim db as New DatabaseCall(\"my db call...\")    \nds = db.ReturnData()\n\n' Breakpoint here: \n' ds.Tables(0).Columns(0).DataType now shows: {Name = \"Decimal\" FullName = \"System.Decimal\"}\n\nGenerateCSVOutput(ds)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><b>How can I force the <code>integer</code> column to remain an <code>integer</code> after the database call? Or how can I change the datatype after populating the dataset?</b></p>\n\n<p>This code has been simplified for posting, but basically the db.ReturnData() is calling an Oracle stored procedure to do some processing and return the data using <code>System.Data.OracleClient.OracleDataAdapter.Fill(dataset)</code> to populate the DataSet. There is no <code>integer</code> column in Oracle so the source table has the column defined as <code>NUMBER(1,0)</code>. It's definitely outputting the correct precision, I just don't understand why the column type in the DataSet is suddenly changing when it is explicitly defined as an integer. Unfortunately the CSV file needs to be uploaded to an external government system that will not accept <code>1.0</code> for <code>1</code>...</p>\n", "Tags": "asp.net vb.net .net-4.0 xsd .net-2.0", "Id": "237", "Title": "DataSet defined by ReadXmlSchema: why do column datatypes change after filling?"}

{"Body": "<p>We are attempting to implement a development environment using virtualization for a small team of 4 developers within an enterprise organization.  This would allow us to set up separate development, testing, and staging environments - as well as allowing access to new operating systems that are requirements for systems or tools we are evaluating.   We re-purposed an existing workstation-class machine, threw in 24GB RAM and RAID-10, and were doing fine until we attempted to get the machine added to the domain.  </p>\n\n<p>Now we are beginning the war that all enterprise developers since the beginning of time have had to fight - the fight for local control of a development and testing environment.  The network and IT admins' have raised concerns ranging from \"ESX Server is the enterprise standard\" to \"servers are not allowed on client VLANs\" to \"[fill-in-the-blank] is not a skill set currently possessed in the local or enterprise IT organization\".</p>\n\n<p>We could justify production-class hardware and formal IT support if we had to, but it would take time and involve a whole lot of headache.  Even then it might take months to formally get IT resources assigned by treating this as a production system - and even if we did, we would likely lose the local control we need.</p>\n\n<p>I imagine that many of you have had similar struggles over developer control of non-production environments - and virtualization in particular - so my questions are as follows:  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>What strategies and arguments have helped you win over the infrastructure (IT &amp; Network) folks to allow these types of silos to exist within enterprises which have standard network and security policies in place that would generally (and understandably) preclude this type of non-(centrally)-managed infrastructure?</li>\n<li>Have you found this to be a matter of technical justification - or more of a political struggle for control and ownership?</li>\n<li>If you ended up with a IT-managed development environment, how much of a roadblock has it been for day-to-day development and testing?</li>\n<li>Has anyone ended up moving their development environment to a disconnected VLAN or entirely separate network to avoid these network access struggles?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Also, this is not a Hyper-V vs. ESX holy war (we would be fine with either - but Hyper-V was selected since it is \"free\" with MSDN for these purposes [yes, VMWare has free tools too - but the good management tools generally aren't], and would be easier to manage by the local developers in a \"Microsoft Shop\") - so arguments for or against either are outside the scope of this question.</p>\n\n<p>This is also less of a virtualization vs. physical hardware - I suppose the same question could be asked without the virtualization component to the equation.</p>\n\n<p>Also assume that the dev team has already made assurances to either manage patch management and antivirus, or integrate with the existing enterprise systems if they will support it.\nThis scenario, with different questions, is also <a href=\"http://serverfault.com/questions/316200/enterprise-network-it-admins-what-is-required-for-developers-to-run-their-own-vm\">posted on SF</a> to hopefully elicit the opposing viewpoint.</p>\n", "Tags": ".net development-environment virtualization", "Id": "328", "Title": "Virtualized Development Environments in Enterprise Networks"}

Specifically, I wanted to see if manually calling <code>ob_start()</code> and <code>ob_flush()</code> would have a huge effect on my program.</p>\n\n<p>I conjured up 10KB of lorem ipsum and went to work. I put a timer in PHP at the start and end of a for loop that writes the 10KB of lipsum (in display:none div blocks) 100 times, for a total of 1MB of data, which I figured would be enough work that random CPU load wouldn't throw off my data too much.</p>\n\n<p>Besides the PHP timer, I popped open Chrome's developer tools (F12) and recorded the \"time\" and \"latency\" field. If I have my terminology correct, the \"time\" is the total amount of time the page took to respond, and render, and \"latency\" is just the time until the page first received data from the server.</p>\n\n<p>So here's the mystery: When I do nothing but write the 10KB of lipsum 100x, my averages are:</p>\n\n<pre><code>PHP Time: 0.00630ms\nChrome Time: 565.6ms\nChrome Latency: 28.3ms\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When I call <code>ob_start()</code> at the very beginning, and <code>ob_flush()</code> at the very end:</p>\n\n<pre><code>PHP Time: 0.00792ms\nChrome Time: 540ms\nChrome Latency: 33ms\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>HOWEVER, and here's the mystery - <strong>when I call <code>ob_start()</code> and <code>ob_flush()</code> at the beginning and end of each 10KB block of text, my Chrome-reported latency spikes by 4x.</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>PHP Time: 0.005814ms\nChrome Time: 624.7ms\nChrome Latency: 134.9ms ???\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>As far as I know, the chrome latency should be <strong>cut</strong> by 100x, since I'm flushing the buffer 1/100 of the way through the PHP output. I know that the <code>ob_start()</code> and <code>ob_flush()</code> operate on a higher buffer, and they actually flush into a lower buffer, I would expect that lower buffer to flush at the same intervals, meaning I would see about the same latency.</p>\n\n<p>My test rig is a very modest Intel ATOM netbook with Nvidia ION graphics, Windows 7 home premium (32-bit) and WAMPserver running Apache 2.2.22 with pretty much default settings. I used Chrome 24.0.1312.52 m.

There will likely never be more than 20,000 records in the entire database and at the moment there are only a few thousand so really a search for just two key words across fields would likely be enough to narrow most searches down to a dozen results.  With one key word though it is impossible.  there might be 1000 records with 2010 as the year so I can't even search by year without getting a flood of results.  The query just needs to find entries with all or some of the words with higher weight given to records that contain more of the keywords.  Most of the keyword searches will look for words often in different fields.  so i might type (2010 economic airlines Florida taxes) and hope to get records for a about 5 reports written in 2010 that dealt with the effects of taxation on the airline industry that were maybe published by authors in Florida or maybe Florida showed up in another field e.g. a Florida based airline, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Sorry for the long winded response.  So, to answer the original question... If you search for \"lobster Souffle\" is should find a record with a Field1 entry of (I ate a souffle made from lobster).  Similary if field one contains (lobster) and field2 contain (souffle) it should find the record and weight it equally since it found two of the search words.</p>\n\n<p><strong>And now two design questions:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Will you ever add a field4, field5, field6, and so on in the future? The reason I'm asking is that you may want to consider abstracting your search keywords into a separate 'search' table or something like that. It's not 'normalised' (if you're not familiar with the term, normalisation means designing your database so that no piece of data will ever be in two places) but it does make things much more efficient. I can explain that a little more later if you want.</strong></p>\n\n<p>I will almost certainly add / remove fields in the future.  I don't know what normalization is.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. I see you're stripping out all characters that aren't alphanumeric (or the space); will you want to be able to deal with apostrophes (like \"wasn't\" or \"O'Ryan\"), hyphens, and so forth?</strong></p>\n\n<p>As mentioned above it would be great to deal with apostrophes and hyphens.  I only have the bit in there that strips those out because that is the way it was done for the example on YouTube that I got the idea from.  I don't think any search phrases will include words like \"isn't\" but might include authors with appostrophes like O'reilly or hyphens like Smith-Galviston.  And there will be middle initials too like \"George P. Scott\"</p>\n", "Tags": "php sql query search weighted", "Id": "368", "Title": "PHP code for multiple-keyword with weighted-results SQL search"}

{"Body": "<p>Another question for my EclipseLink and Spring (MVC and spring-data) version 3.1.1 set-up:</p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to get JPA working without the use of the persistence.xml file in accordance with <a href=\"http://www.baeldung.com/2011/12/13/the-persistence-layer-with-spring-3-1-and-jpa/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a>. In the article it says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Usually, JPA defines a persistence unit through the\n  META-INF/persistence.xml file. Starting with Spring 3.1, this XML file\n  is no longer necessary \u2013 the LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean\n  now supports a \u2018packagesToScan\u2019 property where the packages to scan\n  for @Entity classes can be specified.</p>\n  \n  <p>The persistence.xml file was the last piece of XML to be removed \u2013\n  now, JPA can be fully set up with no XML.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I understand that if one were making use of the persistence.xml file, all Entity classes here should be declared here. However, I'm trying to make use of the <code>packagesToScan</code> property instead. Below is the full startup log and the error produced after making one request to the servlet which ultimately attempts to create a new user in the database. It doesn't seem to recognise that the <code>User</code> object is an Entity. Since I have little experience with Spring, I was wondering if anyone, firstly can spot a mistake I'm making, but otherwise, knows the best way to debug this. I want to know what Entity objects have been recognised by the EntityManagerFactory.</p>\n\n<p>My backup option is to switch to using persistence.xml (haven't tried it yet actually) but I'd like to be rid of that if possible (one less XML file to worry about).</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I've updated the error log after making the recommended config change to the entityManagerFactory, based on the answer by Sean Patrick Floyd but that did not solve the main issue. What I have also done is tried an alternative way of getting this to work by creating a persistence.xml file (the old and more common way of doing this) and added a small piece of test code within the servlet I access to kick off this functionality.\nSo now I have this bit of code in my servlet:</p>\n\n<pre><code>User user = new User();\nuser.setFirstName(\"John\");\nuser.setLastName(\"Doe\");\n// user = userService.addUser(user);\n\nEntityManagerFactory emf = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory(\"proxiPU\");\nEntityManager em = emf.createEntityManager();\nem.getTransaction().begin();\nem.persist(user); \nem.getTransaction().commit();\nem.close();\nemf.close();\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And this persistence.xml file:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?&gt;\n&lt;persistence xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n    xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_2_0.xsd\"\n    version=\"2.0\" xmlns=\"http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/persistence\"&gt;\n\n    &lt;persistence-unit name=\"proxiPU\" transaction-type=\"RESOURCE_LOCAL\"&gt;\n        &lt;provider&gt;org.eclipse.persistence.jpa.PersistenceProvider&lt;/provider&gt;\n        &lt;class&gt;com.proxi.user.User&lt;/class&gt;\n        &lt;exclude-unlisted-classes&gt;false&lt;/exclude-unlisted-classes&gt;\n        &lt;properties&gt;\n            &lt;property name=\"eclipselink.jdbc.driver\" value=\"org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver\"/&gt;\n            &lt;property name=\"eclipselink.jdbc.url\" value=\"jdbc:hsqldb:file:\\Users\\nly31175\\hsqldb;shutdown=true\"/&gt;\n            &lt;property name=\"eclipselink.jdbc.user\" value=\"proxi\"/&gt;\n            &lt;property name=\"eclipselink.jdbc.password\" value=\"\"/&gt;\n            &lt;property name=\"eclipselink.target-database\" value=\"org.eclipse.persistence.platform.database.HSQLPlatform\"/&gt;\n            &lt;property name=\"eclipselink.logging.level\" value=\"FINEST\"/&gt;\n            &lt;property name=\"eclipselink.orm.throw.exceptions\" value=\"true\"/&gt;\n            &lt;property name=\"eclipselink.ddl-generation\" value=\"drop-and-create-tables\"/&gt;\n            &lt;property name=\"eclipselink.ddl-generation.output-mode\" value=\"database\"/&gt;\n        &lt;/properties&gt;\n    &lt;/persistence-unit&gt;\n&lt;/persistence&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This actually works so I'm wondering now whether it's a problem with the way the EntityManagerFactory is initialised or something like that.

He talked about the religion, the rites, the position of women, etc. etc., and the czar sounded quite interested.

Then, the czar pointed out, islam could not be an option in Russia.</p>\n\n<p>The Wikipedia page on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism_in_Russia\">Alcoholism in Russia</a> states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Legend holds that the tenth-century Russian prince Vladimir the Great rejected Islam as a state religion for the country because of its prohibition of alcohol.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...which is sourced from <em>Primary Chronicle, year 6494 (986)</em>.

The emissaries visited the Christians of the Latin Rite, the Jews and the Muslims, they finally arrived in Constantinople. <strong>They rejected Islam because</strong>, among other things, <strong>it prohibited the consumption of alcohol</strong>, and Judaism because the god of the Jews had permitted his chosen people to be deprived of their country. They found the ceremonies in the Roman church to be dull. But, at Constantinople, they were so astounded by the beauty of the cathedral of Hagia Sophia and the liturgical service held there, that they made up their minds there and then about the faith they would like to follow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>which is sourced in its entirety as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Janet Martin, Medieval Russia, 980\u20131584, (Cambridge, 1995), p. 6-7</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The first source calls it a legend, and I'm not sure whether the second source is meant to be historical or also more like a story.

{"Body": "<p>In angular, I have an object that will be exposed across my application via a service.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the fields on that object are dynamic, and will be updated as normal by bindings in the controllers that use the service. But some of the fields are computed properties, that depend on the other fields, and need to be dynamically updated.</p>\n\n<p>Here's a simple example (which is working on jsbin here: <a href=\"http://jsbin.com/erudis/21/edit\">http://jsbin.com/erudis/21/edit</a>). My service model exposes fields <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> where <code>c</code> is calculated from <code>a + B</code> in <code>calcC()</code>. Note, in my real application the calculations are a lot more complex, but the essence is here.</p>\n\n<p>The only way I can think to get this to work, is to bind my service model to the $rootScope, and then use $rootScope.$watch to watch for any of the controllers changing <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> and when they do, recalculating <code>c</code>.

It seems like a lot of javascript tutorials are produced by javascript programmers who don't know what exactly it is they are doing. What are some good tutorials that involve a developer going over code, thinking aloud (CORRECTLY) about Javascript? Also rails+javascript materials. Sorely lacking. There is not a single book out on Rails 3 + Javascript, which is crazy because so much has changed since 2006's \"Ajax on Rails\". What resources do you know of other than \"lots of time\"? \nb.) RJS, Coffeescript, etc v. Javascript + Jquery (or alt.)\nWhat are the weaknesses of using the 'higher-level' abstracted languages and what are the benefits. And most importantly for me, a rails user, <strong>what is the solution that is most likely to be compatible with rails 2 years from now??</strong> RJS sounded like a great idea. But it used prototype right? Is there an \"RJS\" which is Rails 3 ready?</p>\n\n<p>** And, again, guys, the book issue.
